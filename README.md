# Mediapipe-YOLO_Multiperson
The code can detect multiple person poses of mediapipe using YOLO

The code for running it is:
#python3 yolo_opencv.py --image sit.jpg --config yolov3.cfg --weights yolov3.weights --classes yolov3.txt

You have to install all the things that this project needs (I don't remember them, but for sure with stackoverflow you'll be fine uwu)
I know is not the best code but I'm proud of it
